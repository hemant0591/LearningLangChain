Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.\\n\\nâ€œItâ€™s either really valuable or really dangerous,â€\\x9d said Ron.\\n\\nâ€œOr both,â€\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didnâ€™t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\\n\\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.\\n\\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\\n\\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyoneâ€™s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\\n\\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\\n\\n\\n\\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\"),\n",

Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldnâ€™t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.\\n\\nâ€œDonâ€™ mention it,â€\\x9d said Hagrid gruffly. â€œDonâ€™ expect youâ€™ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys.

A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.\\n\\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.\\n\\nâ€œGood afternoon,â€\\x9d said a soft voice. Harry jumped.
