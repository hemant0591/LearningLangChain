One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.\\n\\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snapeâ€™s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.\\n\\nâ€œI do feel so sorry,â€\\x9d said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, â€œfor all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because theyâ€™re not wanted at home.â€\\x9d\\n\\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then heâ€™d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.\\n\\nIt was true that Harry wasnâ€™t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didnâ€™t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas heâ€™d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.\\n\\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.\\n\\nâ€œHi, Hagrid, want any help?â€\\x9d Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.\\n\\nâ€œNah, Iâ€™m all right, thanks, Ron.â€\\x9d\\n\\nâ€œWould you mind moving out of the way?â€\\x9d came Malfoyâ€™s cold drawl from behind them. â€œAre you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose â€” that hut of Hagridâ€™s must seem like a palace compared to what your familyâ€™s used to.â€\\x9d\\n\\nRon dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.\\n\\nâ€œWEASLEY!â€\\x9d\\n\\nRon let go of the front of Malfoyâ€™s robes.\\n\\nâ€œHe was provoked, Professor Snape,â€\\x9d said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. â€œMalfoy was insultinâ€™ his family.â€\\x9d\\n\\nâ€œBe that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,â€\\x9d said Snape silkily. â€œFive points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isnâ€™t more. Move along, all of you.â€\\x9d\\n\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.\\n\\nâ€œIâ€™ll get him,â€\\x9d said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoyâ€™s back, â€œone of these days, Iâ€™ll get him â€”â€\\x9d\\n\\nâ€œI hate them both,â€\\x9d said Harry, â€œMalfoy and Snape.â€\\x9d\\n\\nâ€œCome on, cheer up, itâ€™s nearly Christmas,â€\\x9d said Hagrid. â€œTell yeh what, come with me anâ€™ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.â€\\x9d\\n\\nSo the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.\\n\\nâ€œAh, Hagrid, the last tree â€” put it in the far corner, would you?â€\\x9d\\n\\nThe hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.\\n\\nâ€œHow many days you got left until yer holidays?â€\\x9d Hagrid asked.\\n\\nâ€œJust one,â€\\x9d said Hermione. â€œAnd that reminds me â€” Harry, Ron, weâ€™ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.â€\\x9d\\n\\nâ€œOh yeah, youâ€™re right,â€\\x9d said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.\\n\\nâ€œThe library?â€\\x9d said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. â€œJust before the holidays? Bit keen, arenâ€™t yeh?â€\\x9d\\n\\nâ€œOh, weâ€™re not working,â€\\x9d Harry told him brightly. â€œEver since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel weâ€™ve been trying to find out who he is.â€\\x9d\\n\\nâ€œYou what?â€\\x9d Hagrid looked shocked. â€œListen here â€” Iâ€™ve told yeh â€” drop it. Itâ€™s nothinâ€™ to you what that dogâ€™s guardinâ€™.â€\\x9d\\n\\nâ€œWe just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, thatâ€™s all,â€\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ€œUnless youâ€™d like to tell us and save us the trouble?â€\\x9d Harry added. â€œWe mustâ€™ve been through hundreds of books already and we canâ€™t find him anywhere â€” just give us a hint â€” I know Iâ€™ve read his name somewhere.â€\\x9d\\n\\nâ€œIâ€™m sayinâ€™ nothinâ€™, said Hagrid flatly.\\n\\nâ€œJust have to find out for ourselves, then,â€\\x9d said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\\n\\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamelâ€™s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasnâ€™t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.\\n\\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasnâ€™t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew heâ€™d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\\n\\nâ€œWhat are you looking for, boy?â€\\x9d\\n\\nâ€œNothing,â€\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nMadam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.\\n\\nâ€œYouâ€™d better get out, then. Go on â€” out!â€\\x9d\\n\\nWishing heâ€™d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed theyâ€™d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure sheâ€™d be able to tell them, but they couldnâ€™t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.\\n\\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasnâ€™t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasnâ€™t surprising theyâ€™d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.\\n\\nFive minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.\\n\\nâ€œYou will keep looking while Iâ€™m away, wonâ€™t you?â€\\x9d said Hermione. â€œAnd send me an owl if you find anything.â€\\x9d\\n\\nâ€œAnd you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,â€\\x9d said Ron. â€œItâ€™d be safe to ask them.â€\\x9d\\n\\nâ€œVery safe, as theyâ€™re both dentists,â€\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork â€” bread, English muffins, marshmallows â€” and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldnâ€™t work.\\n\\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ronâ€™s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family â€” in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen werenâ€™t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.\")]"
