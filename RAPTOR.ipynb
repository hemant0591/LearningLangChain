    "### RAPTOR: Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG systems need to handle lower-level questions that reference specific facts found in a single document or higher-level questions that distill ideas that span many documents. Handling both types of questions can be a challenge with typical k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) retrieval over document chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAPTOR is an effective strategy that involves creating document summaries that capture higher-level concepts, embedding and clustering those documents, and then summarizing each cluster."

He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.'),\n",
